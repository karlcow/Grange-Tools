# Tools for La Grange

I'm using tools to publish, check things once in a while, sometimes just once. These are really stupid tools not always well written (suggestions and improvements are welcome). I will add them little by little when I have time.

## Validation.py

My Web site is entirely made of static files. I wanted to check a few things with regards to these files.

Given a list of URIs such as

    http://www.la-grange.net/2006/12/08
    http://www.la-grange.net/2006/12/09

Get the following result listing Validation, encoding of the page as served by the server and encoding declared in the page..

    http://www.la-grange.net/2006/12/08
    validation: Valid 0 0
    encoding-server: application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8; qs=0.999
    encoding-page: utf-8
