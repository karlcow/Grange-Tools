This has been tested on Firefox 36.
Any new issue is welcome. 
Even better code to fix the bookmarklet.

## Caveats:

* It fails on some https Web sites due to the new CSP policy.


## License:
* MIT License for my code.

## Code origin:
* The DOM to MarkDown conversion is done through a piece of code which I found on [David Bengoa's gist](https://gist.github.com/YouWoTMA/1762527) but searching through GitHub, it seems it comes from the [unmarked](https://github.com/thesunny/unmarked) project by [thesunny](https://github.com/thesunny).
* The rest of the code is mine and licensed under MIT License.
